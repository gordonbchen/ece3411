# SPI: Serial Peripheral Interface
* communication w/ external devices
* 4 pins, host (microcontroller) and client (sensor)
    * SCLK: serial clock (from host)
    * MOSI (master out slave in): host signal
    * MISO (master in slave out): client signal
    * SS: client select
* 1 host to many clients, share SCLK, MOSI, MISO, SS different
* host sends MOSI to receive MISO

modes: synchronization
normal (byte by byte, slower, more interrupts) vs buffer mode (buffered, faster, less interrupts)

MCP 4131: digital potentiometer
* 8-pin digital pot
* 7-bit resolution
* 50kOhm max resistance

16-bit command
* 4 addr (addr of register on MCP4131)
* 2 command (00 write, 11 read)
* 10 data (wiper setting)

# Digital Input

naive button circuit
* button not pressed: circuit is open, read input low
* button pressed: circuit closed, read input high

pull-up
* button not pressed: vcc connected to pin, read input high
* button pressed: vcc connected to ground, read input low
* requires pull-up resistor

PULLUPEN: pull-up enable bit 3 of PIN2CTRL
* internal pull-up resistor, no need for external

reading a logic value
* 8-bit (char) register PORTB.IN has logic values for all pins
* bitmask PORTB.IN & PIN7_bm, selects pin 7 logic value
* recall: pull-up, so 1 means button is not pressed, 0 means button is pressed

mechanical switch bounce
* voltage high/low very fast, signal bounces before stabilizing
* debouncing: flag to check if button is being pressed (don't re-register button click if flag is true)
* hardware debouncing: low-pass filter (filters out high freq noise)

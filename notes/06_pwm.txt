# PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
* digital PWM signal mimics analog
* duty_cycle = on_time / period -> effective_voltage

* pulse width: period * duty_cycle
* smallest period with n bit resolution = 2^n / clock_freq

duty_cycle = (1 + CMPn) / (1 + PER)
freq = prescaler * (1 + PER) / F_CPU

Slope modes
* single slope: higher PWM freq (power converter)
* dual slope: symmetric waveform, less EMI

PORTMUX to route TCA0 output to desired port

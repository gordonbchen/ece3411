Digital output

GPIO: General Purpose Input/Output

AVR128DB48: 8-bit microcontroller
* 128kb flask, DB family, 48 pins, 

Pins grouped by A (8), B (6), C (8), D (8), E (4), F (7)

Parens mean the pin can be an analog/digital pin or external clock (optional more accurate clock)
* internal vs external crystal oscillator

3 GND (-) and VDD (+): need 3

DAC: digital to analog converter

AVR architecture
* program counter
* instruction register
* register file
* data memory
* ALU
* stack pointer

initialization: register settings for peripherals

each port has 3 hardware registers
* DIR: input (0) or output (1)
* OUT: voltage, high (1) or low (0)
* IN: reading voltage
* PORTA controls 8 pins, PA_DIR has 8 bits

write registers by writing to pointer address

PIN5_bm: bitmask for PIN5
PIN5_bp: bit position for PIN5

virtual ports are single-cycle i/o registers, 1 cycle access vs 2-cycle normal registers
